	graphs vs trees? 
	> a tree is meant to use key-value pairs and get to the items quickly. 
		storing some data: retrieving the data by key. 
		at some point may care abt reproducing items in order. (more or less linear time)
	> graph can be used for modelling contact tracing, spread of ideas, etc... network model
		there are no parents or children in graphs -- association, not hierarchy
		+ adjacency lists and matrices are the main representations

	
	++ breadth-first search [BFS] ++ 
	robots.txt 
	- needs a source vertex, quque, and bool array to track visited/notvisited
	- runtime O(|V|+|E|)
